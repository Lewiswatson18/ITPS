**Lessons Learned**
My first Landing page, really enjoyed the process of learning how to style a website using HTML/CSS.

Had To Learn alot about Flebox, the box model  and various ways to Style Elements, Had an issue where my Nav bar wasnt responsive after a search on  the internet I came across a series of tutorials and w3 schools which  aided me in figuring where I went wrong.

Also Learned alot about coding standards and indenting child elements, Was worth diving into the deep end to see my project come to life.

Also Learnt about GIT, version control and Git Branches
